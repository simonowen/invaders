Space Invaders port to SAM Coupe (v0.5)
---------------------------------------

The Space Invaders ROMs cannot be distributed with this program, so you must
provide your own copies of the following files:

  invaders.e invaders.f invaders.g invaders.h

Copy them to the same directory as this file, then run make.bat (Windows).
Under Mac/Linux/Un*x, use make to build the final invaders.dsk disk image,
or combine manually using:

  cat disk.base invaders.[hgfe] > invaders.dsk

Enjoy!
